I have initialized a stack and have stored only the distinct values in it as we take the input.
I have tried to exploit the fact that the scores are given in descending order and Alice's scores are given in ascending order.
So, for each of Alice's score if the topmost value in the stack is less than the score, we pop the value.

Thus, the rank we need would be the size of the stack + 1
